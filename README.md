# IBCL sklearn Tutorial

This document aims to give a brief tutorial to share some of the methods learned during Professor Andrew Delong's course: COMP6321 (Machine Learning) offered at Concordia University. It is loosely based off lessons learned from the final assignment for the course, reprogrammed and conducted on a more building related problem.

*** Note originally created for internal use/discussion within the IBCL team. I am not an expert on this content, and there may be conventions missing from this document.

The jupyter notebook covers the following.
* Part 1 — Default Models, Dummy Classifiers, and Cross Validation
* Part 2 — Hyperparameter tuning using random search
* Part 3 — Sklearn Pipeline
* Part 4 — Custom Transformers and Estimators
